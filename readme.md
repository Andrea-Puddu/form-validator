## Udemy Course

I made this project at online course [Build 20 mini frontend projects from scratch with HTML5, CSS & JavaScript](https://www.udemy.com/course/web-projects-with-vanilla-javascript/) by Brad Traversy.
I just added some more CSS styles and refactored some functions. I also improved the password2 check.

## Project Specifications

- Create form UI
- Show error messages under specific inputs
- checkRequired() to accept array of inputs
